# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## To Do

1. Create Pre-Algebra preactice question section ex. practicing adding and subtracting negative numbers.
This will be a route with a sidebar much like reviews except the buttons will pull up different types of questions (negatuve numbers, conversions etc.) and the functions will be pulled from a seperate js file.

2. Add in all my review txts. They are not organized in a way to easily load them but that's just a lot of manual work.

3. Bug fixes, mainly why all the txts don't always load when going to reviews.

## OnGoing notes

react-gh-pages doesn't seem to be deploying this correctly. Starts fine as a react app.

Changed BrowserRouter to HashRouter and nothing changed. Turns out my homepage in package.json was not at all correct. Website now loading

Adding in my reviews section, right now just doing some testing to see how to go about implementing it.
useEffect is going off more than once on refresh so need to figure that out. Tried using the iterator in the for loop to switch between txts but it didn't seem to work, that will be fixed first.

I ended up splitting things into a few different functions, mimicking what I did in music quiz. Speaking of mimicking, realized I needed to add js files to tailwind.config, a strange library this is.
