Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth-
Was not expecting this game to probably be my goty cause I’m not even a big FF& fan. Everything is a big improvement from Remake, and there is a lot of care put into everything about thai game. Aspects I’ve seen complained about Rebirth are things that are totally in my wheelhouse. Like maybe this game could be a dungeon and a half shorter but the combat is fun enough that I didn’t really care. I’ll add to this later just gushing on things I liked about this game.
