Unicorn Overlord-
What a good Fire Emblem game (though I’ve heard it’s basically ogre battle). Just a ton of content, great visuals, amazing music, and gameplay that scratches the Fire Emblem itch I get. I’m more positive on the story compared tot he average FE story (which is typically mediocre) because the game is long enough that is can’t just do a regular story. It’s not good enough to rave about it but I did get more attached to the world and characters by the end of the game. Here’s hoping they update the game to give it like a Palace of the Dead or a ng+.
