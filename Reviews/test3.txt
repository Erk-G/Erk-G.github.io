Dragons Dogma 2-
Might be my biggest disappointment of the year. Worse than DD1 in all ways except maybe combat feel. You could try to make the arguement that comparing this to dark arisen is unfair for x and y or that the performance is reasonable considering the original state but I never got far into dark arisen because I played through the original. DD2 runs pretty bad, most of the quests are pretty dull, the main quests are worse than DD1 counterparts and also stop existing. Endgame was a cool idea, and could have had a way bigger impact than DD1's but I had zero attatchment to the world and there was like no build up. Read theories online about things that happened at the end and they're all really cool but the game itself never says anything and if you've never played DD1 there is no way you could have come to the same conlclusion. I haven't even brought up the thing I hated the most about this game, enemy encounters every like 10 seconds of walking. I don;t even think there are more small enemies than in DD1. So much for being a finished game this time around.
